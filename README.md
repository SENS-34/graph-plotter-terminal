## GRAPH PLOTTER TERMINAL
**A simple graph plotter made in python which runs in terminal**
- **graph-plotter.py** -- Plots graph of any equation or inequation
- **graph-plot-overwrite.py** -- Plots graph overwriting previous ones
## Screenshots
Equation: x == 2*y + 10

 Equation: x\*\*2 + y\*\*2 <= 70

 Equation: x > 5 and y > 5

## How to use
- Download and run **graph-plotter.py** or **graph-plot-overwrite.py** by ```python3 path/to/graph-plotter.py```
- Enter the graph size (size is 20 in screenshots)
- Then write equations with proper operators and press enter
>\+ --> plus
>
>\- --> minus
>
>\* --> multiply
>
>/ --> divide
>
>\*\* --> exponent
>
>== --> equals to
>
>\> --> greater than
>
>< --> less than
>
>\>= --> greater than or equals to
>
><= --> less then or equals to

- You can use **'and'** and **'or'** operators for multiple equations (see screenshot 3)
- In **graph-plot-overwrite.py**, you can type **'undo'** to undo previous equation's graph
